# AspNet.Identity3.MongoDB

An implementation for MongoDB.Driver (>= v2.0.0) with ASP.NET 5 Identity (>= v3) framework at <https://github.com/aspnet/Identity>


## Default details
AspNet.Identity3.MongoDB follows the EntityFramework naming defaults where possible, but they can be overridden 
when instantiating the RoleStore and UserStore.

The default Mongo details are:

* Database Name: AspNetIdentity
* Role Collection Name: AspNetRoles
* User Collection Name: AspNetUsers
* Mongo Collection Settings: WriteConcern.WMajority


# WARNING
RoleStore.Roles and UserStore.Users are functions to return a IQueryable of roles/users.
However MongoDb have not yet implemented any AsQueryable functionality in MongoDB.Driver yet.
- <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-935>
- <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29124995/is-asqueryable-method-departed-in-new-mongodb-c-sharp-driver-2-0rc>

At the moment I have implemented the IQueryable from a ToList() the role/user collections.
**This will not perform well.**

I highly recommend you don't use Queryable functions unless you are very, very sure it will always be a small collection.

I'm keeping an eye on <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-935> and will update the implementation when possible.
